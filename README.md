# Inazuma Eleven Go Script
___________________________________________________________________________
**Disclaimer**

I'm not affiliated with Level-5, I'm just a big gan who loves his work, I don't steal their work it's their work.  
I share the documentation about the scripts for people who want to modify their game, understand the game.

**Language Script**

Squirrel: Level 5 used Squirrel 2.2.3 stable version to manage several parts of the game like events (map event, match event, the match system, ...)   
XQ32/XSEQ: this is Level 5's proprietary script format, to control the menus see more information [here](https://github.com/onepiecefreak3/XtractQuery)

**How to Get Script**

I don't share the scripts, you have to get them by yourself.  
You have to decrypt the ie_a.fa file with karameru   
and go to the folder ie_a_fa/data/script,  
you will find a lot of files with .nutb extension (I continue later)
